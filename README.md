## 📌 Project Summary

The **Zoo Management System (ZMS)** is a database-driven web application designed to simplify zoo operations like animal management, visitor bookings, and ticketing through a user-friendly interface.

This project aims to integrate key DBMS principles—such as ER modeling, SQL queries, normalization, and web-database integration—into a real-world scenario.

> 🐘 *"From enclosure to experience — making zoo visits seamless with smart database systems."*
